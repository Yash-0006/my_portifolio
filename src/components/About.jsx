I'm Yaswanth Godavarthi â€” part coder, part coffee-fueled night owl, and full-time problem solver. When I'm not turning console.log() into a lifestyle, Iâ€™m busy translating complex ideas into clean, efficient code (with a sprinkle of sarcasm and a whole lot of semicolons). </span><br />

<br />I specialize in crafting responsive, pixel-perfect frontend experiences using React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript â€” and yes, I still get excited when a Flexbox layout works on the first try. <br />

<br />But I donâ€™t just live in the browser â€” the backend is where I unleash my inner architect. With Node.js, Express, and my good old friends MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, I build robust APIs and databases that actually understand what performance means. Whether itâ€™s structured or flexible data, Iâ€™ve got it covered. <br />

<br />Outside of code? Iâ€™m the teamâ€™s go-to for debugging weird bugs, pitching wild ideas, and keeping things light with terrible (read: excellent) puns. I believe every great project starts with curiosity, teamwork, and maybe a meme or two. <br/>

<br />Whether itâ€™s solving a tricky logic puzzle, collaborating on a hackathon, or building apps that actually make life easier â€” Iâ€™m all in. Letâ€™s build something awesome. ðŸš€</p>
